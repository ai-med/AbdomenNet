# Abdomennet - Pytorch implementation

A fully convolutional network for quick and accurate segmentation of abdominal organs
-----------------------------------------------------------
## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites
Please install the required packages for smooth functioning of the tool by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training your model

```
python run.py --mode=train
```

### Evaluating your model

```
python run.py --mode=eval
```

## Evaluating the model in bulk

Execute the following command for 3-view aggregated evaluations:
```
python run.py --mode=eval_bulk
```
This saves the segmentation files at nifti files in the destination folder.
